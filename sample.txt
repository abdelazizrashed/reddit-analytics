The base for an amazing game is there, but it doesn't grow, it doesn't evolve, which not only is to be expected of an MMO, but is somewhat in contradiction with the original manifesto.\n\nMore than anything, it is disconcerting to me to see the franchise fade away due to neglect.

{"body":"&gt;Do you believe that social equity is particularly lacking in video games, as opposed to other forms of media and/or art? If so, in what ways?\n\nI think that video games as a whole, when you count mobile and indie games, is incredibly diverse. The areas where they are lacking are generally those with large budgets since developers tend appeal to the largest groups. It's not really any different from television and movies in that respect. The main difference is that the demographics in video games are much more young/male than movies so the video games which get made will reflect that.\n\n&gt;Do you believe that video games are a medium via which social values should be progressed? If so, how so? If not, why not?\n\nYes. I definitely think games can carry and deliver social values. And not only that, these games already exist. Many tend to be critiques of video games and video game culture rather than society at large. (See [AVGM](http://edmundmcmillen.blogspot.com/2009/02/avgm-retrospective.html), [Cow Clicker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cow_Clicker), [Spec Ops: The Line](http://www.polygon.com/2012/11/14/3590430/dont-be-a-hero-the-full-story-behind-spec-ops-the-line), etc). As more people get on board with the idea and start buying such games more such games will be made.\n\n&gt; What is your opinion of the presence of social equity in video games over the lifetime of video gaming? Have things gotten better or worse, and what games or characters make you feel this?\n\nThe stories have gotten better and the characters are more interesting than before. The capacity for games to create and express such stories has grown because platform(s) that allow for distribution have grown large enough to have an audience for these games and the technology out there allows for developers to focus more on fleshing out the game rather than debugging code.","created_utc":"1420070535","downs":0,"author":"pooptarts","score":2,"archived":false,"distinguished":null,"id":"cnasb2p","score_hidden":false,"name":"t1_cnasb2p","link_id":"t3_2qyihl","gilded":0,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"retrieved_on":1425124256,"ups":2,"subreddit_id":"t5_3441a","edited":false,"controversiality":0,"parent_id":"t3_2qyihl","subreddit":"AgainstGamerGate"}

Society still has an idea of what is masculine and what is feminine and it likes its men and women to conform to those.  \n\nI'm sure you wouldn't want to be told that you have a manly voice or that you are very hairy, but these are things that a man would probably like for himself. If I said you had a manly face, I'm guessing you wouldn't be too pleased (maybe you would, I don't know you) but if someone told me that, I'd be giddy. The phrase \"you throw like a girl\" is misleading (at least as far as I interpret it). On the surface it seems like it means that girls cannot throw, but it is more akin to \"you don't throw like a boy.\"  \n  \n\nI don't know that I can answer the last part. Personally, I don't see why women doing things makes them no longer manly, but I'll do my best to explain what I think it is.  \n\nAs far as I can tell, it is something to do with it no longer being masculine. If anyone can do it, how is it masculine? So when a man wants to assert his masculinity, he has to look for something else. The more women start doing traditional men things, the harder it is to find something manly.  \n\nIt's all very silly, but things like this always are.
